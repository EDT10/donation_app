The app is a basic donation app similar to gofundme website. It asks user to login before they can donate. If you don't have a log in credential, you can register a new username and password. The new user created is added to a dictionary which allows you to log into the app with the newly created user. Any amount donated will be added to a empty donation list. The app allows you to also view all your donations.
